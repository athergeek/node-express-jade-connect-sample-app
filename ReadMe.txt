This is a very simple application developed in HTML5, Express.js, Jade views, node.js and connect middleware  which can
be a good reference/starting point for someone who is new to these technologies and wants some quick tips
code to develope an application where you just need some screens to insert/update/delete/view data.

Disclaimer:
This application was written specifially to learn Express.js. While writing this i did't pay attention to javascript
design patterns, so you may find yourself thinking " Oh this should have been something like this instead of that".
You are more then welcome to suggest code imporvements.
I only used in memory objects to quickly complete this application. Next i will encorporate this with MongoDB, CouchDB
and may be SQLServer as well.
